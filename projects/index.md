            <span class="title">European Holocaust Research Infrastructure: Knowledge Graph (EHRI-KG)</span>
            <span class="lifespan">January 2025 - present</span>
            <p class="description">The European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) aims to enhance access to information about Holocaust-related historical sources and promote transnational scholarship. Through the EHRI Portal it makes available over 370,000 archival descriptions, from 2,000 institutions worldwide. EHRI-KG is an OSCARS-funded project to develop a comprehensive Linked Open Data (LOD) Knowledge Graph (KG) to complement the EHRI Portal, further advancing data accessibility and aligning with the evolving semantic web and LOD standards.</p>

            <span class="title">European Holocaust Research Infrastructure: Implementation Phase (EHRI-IP)</span>
            <span class="lifespan">February 2024 - present</span>
            <p class="description">The vision of the European Holocaust Research Infrastructure (EHRI) is to secure seamless access to all sources and expertise from across Europe and beyond that are relevant to the study of the Holocaust. It approaches this vision through the development of a pan-European distributed Research Infrastructure that brings together the leading facilities and offers users integrated access to Holocaust resources, expertise and training. In 2018, EHRI was added to the ESFRI Roadmap, and is currently finalising a step-1 application to establish a new European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ERIC), supported by eleven countries. The EHRI-IP project will facilitate EHRI’s implementation phase and ensure a timely start of its operation as an ERIC.</p>

            <span class="lifespan">September 2021 - February 2025</span>
            <p class="description">The EHRI-3 project deepens the integration of Holocaust archives and research that has been undertaken by EHRI since 2010. The project will lead to a substantial increase in the coverage of the EHRI Online Portal, particularly with regards to the holding of very small micro-archives; the development of new digital tools that connect dispersed Holocaust sources; the delivery of state-of-the-art training and education opportunities for researchers and archivists; the continuation and enhancement of the Conny Kristel Fellowship Programme.</p>

            <span class="title">Implementing the Research Software MetaData (RSMD) guidelines to ShExML and DMAOG and CodeMeta generation workflow with ShExML</span>
            <span class="lifespan">May 2024 - October 2024</span>
            <p class="description">Under one of the support actions offered by the FAIR-IMPACT project, this project addressed the implementation of the RSMD guidelines to two research software repositories: the ShExML engine and DMAOG.  As both tools are devoted to third-party users for reusing them for their own use cases, it was determined that improving their FAIR attributes was essential for their dissemination. Moreover, within this project a workflow based on a set of mapping rules in ShExML was developed showcasing the possibility to generate CodeMeta files from extrinsic metadata providers (e.g., Zenodo, Github and Maven) in a more repeatable, adapatable and shareable manner.</p>
