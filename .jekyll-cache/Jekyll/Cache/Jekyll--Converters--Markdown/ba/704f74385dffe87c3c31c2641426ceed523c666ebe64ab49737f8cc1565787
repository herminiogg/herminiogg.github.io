I"¹<p>These days I was preparing the <a href="https://arquisoft.github.io/">Software Architecture</a> course that we will be starting in a few weeks. So, I decided to create a small to-do list app with React and Solid to get in touch with these technologies that we will be using in the course. While I was making the prototype I realised that this prototype alongside the creation process could be a very interesting starting guide for my students and also for everyone that would like to start seeing a small example working. The app consist of a small web interface with and input box, a list of tasks and two button to manage Solid persistence. The final look can be seen in the image below.</p>
