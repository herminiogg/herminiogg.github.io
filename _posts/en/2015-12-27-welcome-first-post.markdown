Hi!

This is my first post in this blog. My purpose is to write about my experiences and also some interesting things about computers and programming.

I also intend to post in English and Spanish. These are the languages available in my webpage and my intention is to keep everything translated.

So, be welcome to my blog and feel free to explore and share the posts. If you have any suggestion please contact me at [herminiogg@outlook.com](mailto:herminiogg@outlook.com).

Kind regards,  
Herminio García
